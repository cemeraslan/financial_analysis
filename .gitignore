# Virtual Environments - IMPORTANT
# If your virtual environment folder is INSIDE this project folder,
# list its name here. Based on your prompt (ENV_DIR), if that's
# the actual folder name inside daily_iching_mobile_app, use that.
# If it's outside, you don't need to list it.
ENV_DIR/  # If ENV_DIR is a folder directly inside your project.
venv/     # Common name, include if you might use it.
.venv/    # Another common name.

# Virtual environment components at project root (less ideal)
